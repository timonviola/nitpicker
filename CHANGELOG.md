# Changelog

Notable user-visible changes are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- First-class `provider = "mistral"` support backed by rig's native Mistral client. The
  provider activates automatically once `MISTRAL_API_KEY` is set: `nitpicker init` detects it
  and generates a `mistral` reviewer (previously detected but routed through the generic
  OpenAI-compatible provider with a hardcoded base URL). A `base_url`/`api_key_env` can still
  override the endpoint and key on any `mistral` route, like the other providers.

### Fixed

- A degraded preset review (a job or debate lane failed, no surviving findings) no longer
  synthesizes and posts a clean `No findings. Great job! 🎉` comment. The synthesizer is told
  which presets lost jobs or lanes, and the report starts with a one-line
  `⚠️ Partial review` note naming the angles that were not reviewed. The synthesis text itself,
  `aggregation.json`, and `ask` runs are unchanged.

## [0.10.1] - 2026-09-05

`nitpicker-agent` 0.5.4

### Security

- Updated the TLS and HTTP dependency stack reached through `reqwest` to clear ten RUSTSEC
  advisories (`aws-lc-sys`, `rustls-webpki`, `h2`, `quinn-proto`, `crossbeam-epoch`), plus
  reported unsoundness in `anyhow` and `event-listener`. Lockfile only — no manifest changes,
  so this matters for `cargo install --locked`; an ordinary install already resolved the fixed
  versions.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-09-05

`nitpicker-agent` 0.5.4

### Added

- Optional OpenTelemetry trace export behind the new `otel` cargo feature (off by default):
  set `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` and each run ships one OTLP/HTTP-protobuf trace covering the
  run, review jobs / debate lanes and turns, agents and subagents, LLM calls (usage, answering
  model, retries and failovers), tool calls and compaction, with GenAI semantic-convention
  attributes. Configured only through the standard `OTEL_*` environment variables; prompts, tool
  arguments, tool output and provider error text are never exported. Without the feature a set
  endpoint logs one warning and the run proceeds unchanged.
- `nitpicker-agent`: the agent loop and LLM boundary now emit `tracing` spans (`invoke_agent`,
  `chat`, `llm.attempt`, `execute_tool`, `compact`) that any subscriber can consume; new
  `telemetry` module documents the attribute contract, and `SessionLogger::id` names the session.

### Changed

- `main` no longer calls `process::exit`: the outcome is mapped to the unchanged 0/1/3 contract
  after the runtime is torn down and telemetry is flushed. Stderr log lines keep their shape.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-09-03

`nitpicker-agent` 0.5.3

### Added

- Record the nitpicker version, build revision, and compiled protocol-prompt fingerprint in each
  logged session (`attribution.json`) so `reflect` experiments can compare attributable cohorts.

### Changed

- Review debates: every Reviewer verdict ends with a mandatory Coverage block; the Validator
  checks it against the review snapshot and rejects only gaps that could change the finding set
  (wording or grouping differences are not grounds), and rejecting every submitted finding is
  now `agree=false` with the critique instead of an agreeing empty verdict.
- Reviewer follow-up turns must verify technical premises newly entering the verdict against the
  repository, resolve any first-turn uncertainty, and keep one smallest correction per finding.
- Follow-up debate rounds carry a "respond only to disputed points" instruction in both review and
  `ask` mode.
- `spawn_subagent` tells the parent that the subagent starts from an empty conversation and must be
  given revision ids, paths, and claims verbatim; subagents are told to do the task themselves
  rather than re-delegating.
- Diff review base selection prefers `origin/<branch>` when the local branch is behind it (newer
  merge-base with HEAD), with a warning.

### Fixed

- The git tool rejects shell operators (`|`, `&&`, `>`, …) with a message naming the working
  alternative instead of passing them to git as literal arguments.
- `read_file` swaps an inverted `start_line`/`end_line` pair (with a note in the output) instead of
  silently clamping to one line.
- Git tool failures (rejected or non-zero-exit commands) are tool errors rather than successful
  `Error: …` text, so session trajectories record them with error status and message and
  `reflect` no longer counts them as successes.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-08-20

`nitpicker-agent` 0.5.1

### Changed

- Enable prompt caching for first-party Anthropic and Azure Foundry routes, and give Codex
  requests a stable cache-routing key derived from their reusable prefix.
- Keep terminal tool schemas stable when provider-side tool choice can safely constrain execution;
  fall back to the terminal-only subset when multiple terminal tools require structural isolation.

### Fixed

- Prevent non-terminal tool calls from consuming the final turn when multiple terminal tools are
  configured, and report the sorted executable-tool allowlist when the harness rejects a call.

## [0.9.3] - 2026-08-13

`nitpicker-agent` 0.5.0

### Added

- Show an animated repository activity indicator in supported terminal tab/window titles during
  interactive review runs, without changing redirected or `pr --json` output.
- Persist staged reviewer and debate verdicts in session aggregation records so reflection can
  compare execution trajectories with their intermediate and final outcomes.

### Changed

- Calibrate `reflect` with deterministic trace metrics, evidence-counted cross-session claims,
  explicit confidence/tradeoffs, critic-model synthesis, omission of rejected hypotheses from the
  final report, and no shared temp dump.
- Separate debate responsibilities across review and `ask`: Actor/Reviewer owns discovery and
  recall, while Critic/Validator consolidates evidence-based objections to the submitted set and
  does not hunt for new findings/options or manufacture disagreement.
- Give discovery roles an early disjoint delegation default for multi-surface work while limiting
  validation-role subagents to targeted verification of submitted claims.
- Inject one deterministic, commit-pinned review snapshot before fan-out, including base/HEAD,
  merge base, exact comparison semantics, working-tree state, and committed/uncommitted file maps.
- **Breaking (`nitpicker-agent`)**: `AggregationRecord` adds the required
  `verdicts: Vec<VerdictRecord>` field; pre-change aggregation records are not accepted by
  `reflect`.

### Fixed

- Keep diff reviews available when the detected base and HEAD have no merge base by falling back
  to a direct tree comparison, and bound frozen snapshot file maps by rendered bytes.
- Reject token-limit-truncated agent answers instead of publishing partial reports as complete.
- Preserve final per-lane verdicts and both early and late tool evidence within independently
  bounded `reflect` sections.
- Count identical same-turn tool calls as distinct reflection invocations while still collapsing
  a failed subagent spawn's started/error lifecycle pair.
- Persist debate verdict success from the turn outcome rather than inferring it from display text.
- Restore `auth = "agy-keyring"`: the proxy's `loadCodeAssist` request now sends a
  `User-Agent`, without which Google's backend classified the client as the deprecated
  "Gemini Code Assist for individuals" tier and returned no project, 503-ing every request.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-08-10

`nitpicker-agent` 0.4.0

### Added

- Add opt-in ordered reviewer fallback with `fallback = true` or `--fallback`, including
  fallback-capable Alloy routing and aggregator synthesis.

### Changed

- Enable fallback in generated configs whenever `init` can provide at least two reviewer routes.
- **Breaking (`nitpicker-agent`)**: `DefaultsConfig` adds `fallback: Option<bool>`; downstream
  struct literals must set `fallback: None` when fallback is not configured.

### Fixed

- Improve fallback reliability across provider limits, unavailable routes, concurrent review jobs,
  debate lanes, and subagents.
- Require debate agents to submit structured verdicts before accepting a turn as successful.
- Resolve `--repo` through Git so linked worktrees and paths inside a worktree are supported.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-08-09

### Changed

- Debate progress uses one live TTY row per lens, and final findings identify their lens.
- Review prompts reject premature convergence and focus follow-up rounds on unresolved work.
- Security and simplicity checks better distinguish real authority gains, dead code, and live
  compatibility contracts.

### Fixed

- Reject comma-containing custom preset names, which are ambiguous in lens lists.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-09

`nitpicker-agent` 0.3.0

- **Review presets**: four universal defaults (`correctness`, `security`, `performance`,
  `simplicity`), opt-in domain angles (`ai-systems`, `ml-rigor`, `tone`), standalone `general`,
  and project-defined `[presets.<name>]` tables. Parallel mode fans out reviewers × presets;
  debate mode runs one concurrent Reviewer/Validator lane per preset with a global meta-review.
- `pr --json` adds resolved `presets`, `degraded`, and per-preset `coverage`; session and
  transcript artifacts identify their jobs and lanes.
- `pr` reads repository policy from the trusted PR base branch rather than the contributor's
  working tree, with explicit remote-host and object-id checks.
- Synthesis failures persist their job/lane outcomes for `reflect`; trajectories record the
  selected model per turn in alloy runs.
- Review and debate jobs share one 16-call provider concurrency limit. Preset selection and
  context-window failures now fail early with targeted diagnostics.
- Review/debate prompts drop withdrawn findings and chronology; cleanly converged lanes expose
  only their self-contained final round to synthesis.

## [0.8.5] - 2026-08-05

`nitpicker-agent` 0.2.1

- Session recorder fixes: unique per-agent record identities, failed subagent spawns logged,
  1-based `compact` turn numbers, and flushed appends.
- `reflect` no longer renders successful spawns or blocked cycles as failures.

## [0.8.4] - 2026-08-05

- Added repeatable `--context-file <PATH>` injection for review, `ask`, and `pr`, restricted to
  regular files and capped at 256 KiB including wrappers.
- `--repo`, `--config`, and `--verbose` are global flags accepted before or after subcommands.

## [0.8.3] - 2026-08-05

`nitpicker-agent` 0.2.0

- Stable, name-sorted tool definitions improve provider prompt-cache hits.

- Removed fixed agent output caps; added per-reviewer `max_tokens` and a 16,384-token aggregator
  default.
- Improved empty-response diagnostics and recovery from malformed `<think>` blocks.
- Made compaction best-effort and isolated output caps per model in alloy pools.
- Bumped `rig-core` to 0.41.
- **Breaking (`nitpicker-agent`)**: `AgentResult` now carries `usage: TokenUsage`, and
  `AlloyClient::new` accepts `Vec<AlloySlot>`.
